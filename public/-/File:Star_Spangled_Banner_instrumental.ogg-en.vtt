1
00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
O say, can you see

2
00:03.555 --> 00:07.700
by the dawn's early light

3
00:07.900 --> 00:12.000
What so proudly we hailed

4
00:12.500 --> 00:16.100
at the twilight's last gleaming?

5
00:16.600 --> 00:20.400
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

6
00:20.900 --> 00:24.600
through the perilous fight,

7
00:25.100 --> 00:28.900
O'er the ramparts we watched,

8
00:29.400 --> 00:33.200
were so gallantly streaming?

9
00:33.700 --> 00:37.500
And the rockets' red glare,

10
00:37.500 --> 00:40.000
the bombs bursting in air,

11
00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Gave proof through the night

12
00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
that our flag was still there;

13
00:49.000 --> 00:55.700
O say does that star-spangled

14
00:56.200 --> 01:00.000
banner yet wave,

15
01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
O'er the land of the free

16
01:06.000 --> 01:16.500
and the home of the brave?
